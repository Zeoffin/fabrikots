                OF
                THIS AGREEMENT. The Online Service ("Service") is provided to you ("User") under the following Fabrikots
                terms ("Terms"). The Terms comprise the entire agreement between User and Fabrikots and supersede all
                prior
                agreements between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein.

            </p>

            <p>
                2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE
                Fabrikots is providing User with a capability to be cool. User must: (1) provide all
                equipment and communications services, including a computer and modem, necessary to establish a
                connection
                to the World Wide Web and (2) provide for own access to the World Wide Web and pay any connection and
                service fees associated with such access. In consideration for this Service, User agrees to: (1) provide
                certain current, complete, and accurate information about User as prompted to do so by the Service and
                (2)
                maintain and update this information as required to keep it current, complete and accurate. All
                information
                requested on original sign up shall be referred to as registration Information ("Registration
                Information").
                Fabrikots will maintain Registration Information in accordance with these Terms and then current PDF
                Copy
                Paste privacy policy. Should there be any conflict
                between these Terms and Fabrikots's privacy policy, these Terms shall supersede the privacy policy. You
                authorize a recurring monthly or annual charge to your credit card in exchange for use of the Fabrikots
                service as indicated by published standard plans or a customized quote provided for your specific use.
                You
                also agree that the enrollment for the next service period is automatic. Please note that refunds on a
                pro-rated basis are issued only for yearly plans. When yearly subscriptions are cancelled before the
                subscriptions end, refunds are issued based on a pro-rated calculation of the subscription charges at
                the
                monthly rate for the plan, for the actual number of months the account was subscribed (the number of
                months
                between the most recent yearly charges and the cancellation date). If the calculated refund amount
                exceeds
                the yearly subscription rate, then no refund is issued.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fabrikots will not issue any pro-rated refunds for the remaining period during the month when an account
                with a monthly subscription plan ("current plan") is downgraded to a smaller plan ("new plan") (a plan
                that
                costs less per month than the current plan) during the middle of a month. However the rate applicable to
                the
                new plan will automatically be charged starting the first of the subsequent month, and you must contact
                sales@pdfcopypaste.com in order to downgrade. If you attempt to sign up for a downgraded account via the
                online system, it will be considers as a new account and therefore you will be charged for both accounts
                until you cancel your old subscription.
            </p>
